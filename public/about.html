<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>During my academic formation I worked as an Industrial Maintenance and Infrastructures Technician in a plastic injection factory. 
  I also had another job after the internship from high school where I had the chance to build specific machines for big companies 
  like Renault, Ford and Maserati. These experiences gave me an insight of the knowledge and perception necessary to collaborate in 
  a team and be professionally successful.</p>

<p>Before moving to Norway, I was a Worldwide Wind Turbine Technician at ENDIPREV (Portugal). I worked in Oslo afterwards for around
   two years as an Electrician. <br>Currently I’m still an Electrician at Voss on more varied fields, from Electrical installations, 
   Ferry boats to Hydro turbines.</p>

<p>I have a CTeSP in Automation, Robotics and Industrial Maintenance, the degree was obtained at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de 
  Coimbra. In high school I finished the Electrical Technician Course at Escola Secundária de Vagos.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to joining my next team, and this time it will hopefully be in the WebDevelopment field.</p>
